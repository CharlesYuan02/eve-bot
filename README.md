# eve-bot
A Discord bot I created in Python. Her name is Eve. I've been working on her since the summer of 2020, and I said that once I get a working chatbot feature up, I'd host her on Heroku for everyone to use full-time, along with posting the code on my Github. So, at long last, here she is. 

Disclaimer: The images are from an old MMORPG named Elsword. I take no credit.

If you would like more information on her different commands, please refer to my website.
